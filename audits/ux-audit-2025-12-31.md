# UX Audit Report - AxCouncil
## Frictionless Experience & The Mum Test

**Audit Date:** 2025-12-31
**Auditor:** Claude Code
**Application:** AxCouncil - AI Council Decision Platform

---

## Executive Summary

### UX Score: 7.5/10
### Mum Test Score: 6/10

AxCouncil delivers a **polished, sophisticated user experience** for power users but has **significant friction for first-time users**. The core AI Council workflow is well-designed with excellent streaming feedback, but the app assumes users already understand what a "council" of AI models means.

**Key Strengths:**
- Excellent keyboard navigation and power user features
- Well-implemented mobile experience with native patterns
- Sophisticated error prevention with undo support
- Clean, Perplexity-inspired visual design
- Real-time streaming with clear progress feedback

**Key Weaknesses:**
- No onboarding - users must learn by exploration
- Modal-based navigation lacks breadcrumbs
- Search is sidebar-only (no app-wide search)
- Complex concepts unexplained (Council, Stages, Playbooks)
- No help system or documentation

---

## The Mum Test Evaluation

### Would my mum understand this instantly?

| Screen | Mum Test | Issue |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Login | Pass | Google OAuth + simple email/password |
| Landing Hero | Partial | "High-stakes decision" is vague, context icons unexplained |
| OmniBar Icons | Fail | 4 mystery icons (company, departments, roles, playbooks) - hover-only tooltips |
| Council vs Chat Toggle | Fail | No explanation of what "Council mode" means |
| Stage 1 (Models) | Fail | "5 AI advisors" appears after submission - surprise! |
| Stage 2 (Peer Review) | Fail | "Models reviewing each other" - unexpected extra step |
| Stage 3 (Synthesis) | Pass | "Best Answer" is clear |
| My Company Modal | Partial | Tabs are labeled but no guidance on what each does |
| Playbooks | Fail | Technical term - "SOPs" and "Frameworks" unclear |
| Sidebar Hover | Fail | Non-obvious that sidebar expands on hover |

**Mum Test Summary:** A new user can sign up easily but will be confused within 30 seconds of landing. The app requires exploration to understand, which is acceptable for power users but fails the Mum Test.

## Detailed Assessment

### 1. First-Time User Experience (FTUE)

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Landing page explains value | Partial | "Better decisions with AI" - but HOW? |
| Sign-up minimal (3 fields max) | Pass | 2 fields + Google OAuth |
| Onboarding guides without overwhelming | Fail | No onboarding exists |
| Empty states explain what to do | Partial | Generic hints, no "Try this example" button |
| First "aha moment" < 60 seconds | Fail | Users must submit a query to understand the product |
| No dead ends | Pass | All states have logical next actions |
| Progressive disclosure | Fail | All features visible immediately |

**FTUE Score: 4/10**

**Critical Gap:** Users discover what the app does AFTER committing a question, not before. The "reveal" of 5 AI models and 3 stages is a surprise rather than an expectation.

**Recommendations:**
1. Add a "Getting Started" modal on first login showing the 3-stage flow
2. Add clickable example question chips (not just placeholder text)
3. Add "Learn More" tooltips with explanations, not just labels
4. Show a 30-second video walkthrough option

---

### 2. Navigation & Information Architecture

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| User knows where they are | Partial | No breadcrumbs in modals |
| Consistent navigation | Pass | Footer icons consistent |
| Max 3 clicks to any feature | Pass | Most features 1-2 clicks |
| Breadcrumbs where appropriate | Fail | None exist |
| Back button intuitive | Pass | Works correctly |
| Related features grouped | Pass | My Company tabs logical |
| Search for large datasets | Partial | Conversations only, not app-wide |

**Navigation Score: 7/10**

**Navigation Depth Analysis:**
- Chat Interface: 1 click
- Settings: 1 click
- My Company > Decisions: 2 clicks
- Specific Playbook: 2 clicks
- View Decision Source: 3 clicks

**Critical Gap:** Modal-based navigation (Settings, My Company) provides no visual hierarchy. Users can't see "My Company > Decisions > Decision #123" breadcrumb.

**Recommendations:**
1. Add breadcrumbs to modal headers
2. Implement app-wide search (include playbooks, decisions, projects)
3. Add "Return to My Company" indicator when navigating from chat

---

### 3. Core Workflow - AI Council Query

**Happy Path Evaluation:**

| Step | Friction | User Impact |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 1. Arrive on landing | None | Clean hero |
| 2. Select context (company/dept) | Medium | Icons unexplained |
| 3. Type question | None | Good placeholder examples |
| 4. Submit | None | Clear send button |
| 5. Wait for response | None | Excellent streaming feedback |
| 6. Receive Stage 1 | Low | Model cards clear but surprise |
| 7. Receive Stage 2 | Medium | Peer review is unexpected |
| 8. Receive Stage 3 | None | "Best Answer" clear |
| 9. Save decision | Low | Modal options could be clearer |
| 10. Find saved decision | Low | My Company > Decisions works |

**Workflow Score: 8/10**

**Streaming UX Excellence:**
- Real-time token streaming shows progress
- CouncilProgressCapsule shows stage completion %
- Model-by-model completion indicators
- Celebratory animation on final synthesis
- Copy button appears on completion

**Recommendations:**
1. Add "What's happening?" link during Stage 1
2. Pre-announce Stage 2 and 3 before they appear
3. Add stage progress indicator (Stage 1 of 3)

---

### 4. Error Prevention & Recovery

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Destructive actions require confirmation | Pass | ConfirmModal with "Sure? No/Yes" inline pattern |

| Autosave prevents data loss | Fail | No autosave (explicit save only) |
| Clear error messages | Pass | Toast notifications with solutions |
| Graceful network issues | Pass | Error recovery restores items |
| Session timeout handled | Pass | Auth context manages gracefully |

**Error Prevention Score: 8/10**

**Excellent Patterns Found:**
- **ConfirmModal** for destructive actions (danger/warning variants)
- **Inline confirmation** "Sure? No/Yes" for quick actions
- **Optimistic updates** with automatic rollback on failure
- **5-second undo window** for bulk deletions
- **Fade-out animation** provides visual confirmation

**Recommendations:**
1. Add inline form validation (real-time)

3. Add "Most used" section in playbook/role selectors

---

## User Journey Gaps

### New User Journey:
```
CURRENT:
Landing → Type Question → Submit → [SURPRISE: 5 models!] → [SURPRISE: Stage 2!] → [SURPRISE: Stage 3!]

RECOMMENDED:
Landing → "How it works" CTA → 3-stage explainer → Type Question → [Expected: Stage 1] → [Expected: Stage 2] → [Expected: Stage 3]
```

### Power User Journey:
```
CURRENT:
Login → Recent conversation → Continue query → Save decision → Find decision in My Company

GAP:
- No keyboard shortcut to jump to My Company
- No way to search decisions from chat

### Mum Test Score: 6/10

---

## Conclusion

AxCouncil is a **well-crafted application for power users** who understand AI decision-making tools. The streaming UX, keyboard navigation, mobile patterns, and accessibility are all excellent.

However, the app **fails the Mum Test** because it assumes users already know:
- What a "council" of AI models means
- That there are 3 stages to every query
- What playbooks, roles, and departments do
- How to discover the expandable sidebar

**The single biggest improvement** would be a 30-second onboarding modal that explains the 3-stage council concept. This would:
- Set user expectations
- Explain the value proposition
- Reduce confusion during first query
- Potentially increase activation by 30%+

The app is **90% there** - it just needs to bridge the gap between "sophisticated tool" and "instantly understandable experience."

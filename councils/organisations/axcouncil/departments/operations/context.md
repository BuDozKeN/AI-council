## Department Overview

Business operations, AI organizational structure, and process optimization for AxCouncil.

## Roles

- **COO** - Chief Operations Officer: Operational strategy and execution
- **Head of AI People & Culture** - Designs AI org structures, defines roles, creates governance frameworks
- **AI UX/UI Designer** - Zero-friction interface design and user experience optimization

## AI Organizational Philosophy

AxCouncil operates with an **AI-first org structure**. Instead of hiring human staff, we build AI departments that provide execution guidance to the solo founder.

**Key Principle:** Before you can have an AI CTO or AI CMO, you need something that defines what each role does. That's the Head of AI People & Culture - the role that creates all other roles.

### Current AI Org Chart

| Role | Status | Focus |
|------|--------|-------|
| CEO | Founder | Decisions and priorities |
| Head of AI People & Culture | Active | Creates and maintains AI roles |
| AI CTO | Active | Technical execution, deployment |
| AI UX/UI Designer | Active | Zero friction interface design |
| AI CMO | Pending | Marketing execution |
| AI Onboarding Specialist | Merged | Combined into UX/UI Designer role |

## AI Role Design Standard

Every AI role must follow the **Execution Guidance Standard**:

1. **Assume beginner level** - Provide step-by-step instructions
2. **Be concrete** - Exact commands, code samples, templates
3. **Break down tasks** - Max 1-2 hours per step
4. **Include troubleshooting** - Common errors and fixes
5. **Never suggest human hires** - AI handles all execution guidance

## Current Priorities

### Platform Operations
- User onboarding flow optimization
- Knowledge Base curation workflows
- Support process design (AI-assisted)

### Organizational
- Define new AI roles as needed
- Maintain role documentation
- Ensure Execution Guidance Standard compliance

## Key Decisions

| 2025-12-04 | AI Departments vs Human Hires | AI departments handle all execution |
| 2025-12-09 | AI Onboarding Specialist | Merged into AI UX/UI Designer |
| 2025-12-09 | Zero Friction Philosophy | Core product principle |

2.8 Organization Management Capability

Business owners need to configure how their AI Council operates. This requires an Organization Management system where they can:

Core Configuration:
• View and edit departments and their purposes
• Define roles within departments with responsibilities and system prompts
• Set budgets and metadata per department

Organizational Knowledge:
• Create SOPs - step-by-step procedures the AI should follow
• Create Frameworks - methodologies and approaches to apply
• Define Policies - rules and guidelines that constrain AI responses

How It Works:
• All organizational content gets injected into AI prompts automatically
• Documents can be company-wide or department-specific
• AI must follow active frameworks, SOPs, and policies
• If user requests conflict with policies, AI explains the conflict

This transforms the product from generic AI chat to a customized business advisor that knows and follows each company's specific way of operating.

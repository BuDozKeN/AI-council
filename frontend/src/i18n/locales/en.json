      "whatIsCouncil": "What is an AI Council?",
      "whatIsCouncilAnswer": "An AI Council is 5 different AI models (like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) working together. Each one answers your question, they review each other's answers, and then the best insights are combined into one final response.",
      "howManyAIs": "How many AIs are involved?",
      "howManyAIsAnswer": "By default, 5 AI models answer your question in Stage 1. Then 3 models review and rank those answers in Stage 2. Finally, one model synthesizes the best answer in Stage 3.",
      "whatAreStages": "What do the stages mean?",
      "whatAreStagesAnswer": "Stage 1 (Answers): Each AI gives their perspective. Stage 2 (Review): AIs vote on which answer is best. Stage 3 (Synthesis): The top insights are combined into one comprehensive answer.",
      "howLongTakes": "How long does it take?",
      "howLongTakesAnswer": "A full council deliberation typically takes 30-60 seconds. Quick mode (1 AI) is faster at 5-10 seconds.",
      "whatIsDepartment": "What are departments and roles?",
      "whatIsDepartmentAnswer": "Departments and roles help the AI understand your company. When you select 'Marketing' or 'CTO', the AI tailors its advice to that perspective.",
      "whatIsPlaybook": "What is a playbook?",
      "whatIsPlaybookAnswer": "Playbooks are your company's guides - SOPs (how-to procedures), Frameworks (thinking models), and Policies (rules). The AI references these when giving advice.",
      "canITrustAI": "Can I trust the AI's answers?",
      "canITrustAIAnswer": "AI can make mistakes. Always verify important decisions. The council format helps by showing multiple perspectives and highlighting disagreements.",
      "whereDataStored": "Where is my data stored?",
      "whereDataStoredAnswer": "Your data is stored securely in our cloud database. We don't train AI models on your conversations. You can delete your data anytime."

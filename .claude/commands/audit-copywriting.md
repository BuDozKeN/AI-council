# Copywriting & Voice Audit - Words Are Half Your UX

You are a UX writer from Stripe, Mailchimp, or Slack auditing every word in a SaaS product. Copy is not decoration - it's 50% of the user experience. This audit ensures every word earns its place and creates a consistent, human voice.

**The Stakes**: The difference between "Submit" and "Get my insights" is the difference between boring and compelling. Words create emotion, build trust, and drive action. Bad copy kills conversions. Great copy creates fans.

## The Voice Philosophy

```
What Great Product Copy Does:
├── Guides without condescending
├── Informs without overwhelming
├── Delights without distracting
├── Converts without manipulating
└── Sounds human without being unprofessional

The Voice Spectrum:
Boring ←──────────────────→ Human
"Submit form"              "Get started"
"Error occurred"           "Oops, something went wrong"
"No data available"        "Let's create your first one"

Reference Voices:
- Stripe: Professional, clear, confident
- Mailchimp: Friendly, playful, warm
- Slack: Casual, helpful, witty
- Linear: Direct, minimal, powerful
- Notion: Calm, inviting, versatile
```

## Audit Checklist

### 1. Voice Definition

```
Brand Voice Attributes (Define 3-4):
| Attribute | What It Means | What It's NOT |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| [e.g., Confident] | [We know our stuff] | [Arrogant] |
| [e.g., Human] | [Like talking to a friend] | [Unprofessional] |
| [e.g., Clear] | [No jargon, simple words] | [Dumbed down] |
| [e.g., Helpful] | [Anticipates needs] | [Hand-holding] |

```

### 2. UI Copy Inventory

```

| "Cancel" | [Location] | "Never mind" / Keep | Depends on context |
| "OK" | [Location] | "[Specific action]" | Vague |
| [Current] | [Location] | [Better] | [Issue] |

Button Best Practices:

Form Labels:
| Current | Better | Reason |
|---------|--------|--------|
| "Email Address" | "Email" | Shorter is better |

| [Current] | [Better] | [Reason] |

Form Best Practices:
- [ ] Labels are nouns, not instructions
- [ ] Placeholder text adds value (example format)
- [ ] Help text explains why needed
- [ ] Error text is helpful, not scolding
```

### 3. Error Messages

```
Error Message Audit:
| Current Error | Context | Better Version | Tone Issue |
|---------------|---------|----------------|------------|
| "Invalid input" | Form | "Please enter a valid email" | Too technical |
| "Error 500" | Server | "Something went wrong" | Scary |
| "Request failed" | API | "Couldn't connect. Try again?" | Cold |
| [Current] | [Where] | [Better] | [Issue] |

Error Message Formula:
1. What happened (simply)
2. Why it might have happened (if helpful)
3. What to do about it (always)

Examples:
✗ "Invalid email format"
✓ "Hmm, that doesn't look like an email. Check for typos?"

✗ "Session expired"
✓ "You've been logged out for security. Sign in to continue."

CTA: [Specific action]

Remember: Every word is a design decision. The best copy is invisible - it guides without being noticed. But bad copy? That gets noticed instantly. Write like a human, edit like a machine, and always ask: "Would I say this to a friend?"

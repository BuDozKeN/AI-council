# Claude Code Workspace Marker
# This file identifies THIS folder as the primary working directory for AI-council.
#
# PURPOSE: Prevent working in duplicate/copy folders
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
# - This file should exist ONLY in the primary repo clone
# - If you have multiple clones, delete this file from all but ONE
# - Claude Code should check: does .claude-workspace exist in cwd?
#
# RULE: Only ONE folder on your system should contain this file.
# If you find multiple, consolidate your work into one and delete the others.
